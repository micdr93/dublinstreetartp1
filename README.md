## Testing 

I have used validator and used various devices (desktop, ios, android) to test the responsiveness using different browsers (chrome, safari, brave)

I found that the size of the Youtube preview fits nicely on mobile however it was too small on desktop. I fixed this by removing some overlapping code that was causing this issuse.

I have had a little trouble trouble trying to get the images to center nicely on the gallery page on desktop where as on mobile they center nicely. I managed to fix this by removing CSS that was conflicting and causing this issue.
