## Testing 

I have used validator and used various devices (desktop, ios, android) to test the responsiveness using different browsers (chrome, safari, brave)

I found that the size of the Youtube preview fits nicely on mobile however it is too small on desktop.

I have had a little trouble trouble trying to get the images to center nicely on the gallery page on desktop where as on mobile they center nicely.
### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  -No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator] https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmicdr93.github.io%2Fdublinstreetartp1%2Findex.html
