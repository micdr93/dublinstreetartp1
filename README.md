## Testing 

I have used validator and used various devices (desktop, ios, android) to test the responsiveness using different browsers (chrome, safari, brave)

I found that the size of the Youtube preview fits nicely on mobile however it is too small on desktop.

I have had a little trouble trouble trying to get the images to center nicely on the gallery page on desktop where as on mobile they center nicely.
### Validator Testing 

- HTML

- CSS

# Deployment



- The site was deployed using replit at the start to run live tests of styling and deployed using gitpod and github.
